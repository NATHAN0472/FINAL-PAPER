# Analysis of factors affecting the social safety of communities in the Greater Toronto Area over the past 6 years (2014-2020)

# About
This report focuses on a comprehensive statistical study of the security situation in different communities in the Greater Toronto Area to provide a valuable reference for people who want to settle in Toronto and guide government workers responsible for social security. In general, communities where crime is frequent, tend to have poor social security systems that allow criminals to commit crimes, and communities where fewer crimes occur mean that local police supervision is reasonable and strict. Using statistical methods, we obtained a model of the security situation in Toronto communities, a model that explains well the factors that contribute to crime incidents in Toronto. This model tells us that crime rates in some Toronto-area communities over the past six years are strongly related to the population of that community and three types of crime incidents: assault, break-ins, and robberies.
